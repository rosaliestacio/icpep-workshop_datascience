IKIGAI - japanese term....

"DATA SCIENCE IS THE DISCILINE THAT MAKES DATA USEFU" = CASSIE KOZYRKOV

understanding data science is having business understanding, be able to translate modeol into business decisions or applications. 

importance of DATA STORY TELLING in business 

go back to why you need such mathematical models, or formulas used... how does itmake sens to the business

 ** always report the shape of the data
cite the difference of the shape after data preparation


TYPES OF DATA
1. NUMERICAL
2. CATEGORICAL


DATA UNDERSTANDING

univariate - just a single variable

LAW of large numbers = if you repeatedyly, iteratively.. then you wil reach E[X]
E[X] = expected value or mean

STATISTICAL VS. MACHINE LEARNING

Machine learning and predictive modeling focus on algorithmic methods and model skills


Statistical and statistical learning are mathematical perspective on modeling data with focus on data models and goodness of fit... .. that is idea of sampling (finding the best sample)
- you can see significant variables, relationship
Frequenties - based on sampling 
Bayesian = works on the idea of conditional probability
** no decision >> no statistics
**used random in selecting sample to avoid bias

Descriptive stats - for summarizing data
inferential - for drawing conlcusions from sample of data
Moment:
mean - 1st moment
variance - 2nd moment
skewness - 3rd 
kurtosis - 4th

HYPOTHESIS TESTING
Population vs. sample
parameter vs. statistic
 
HYPOTHESIS TESTING - for decision making
0. Default action - based on sample
1.NUll hypothesis - immediate action, status quo
2. create model - gather data (random)
3. do calculation- go back to distrbution of your data
4. decide (reject or not reject?)

numerical
1. z-test:if you know the population
2. t-test

categorical
1. use chi square
F (anova): comparing more than 2 variable to compare
